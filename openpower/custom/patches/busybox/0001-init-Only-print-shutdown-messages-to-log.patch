Subject: [PATCH] init: Only print shutdown messages to log

We disable them from appearing on the console so users are not confused
as the system kexec's to the next kernel. This suppresses these
messages:

 The system is going down NOW!
 Sent SIGTERM to all processes
 Sent SIGKILL to all processes
